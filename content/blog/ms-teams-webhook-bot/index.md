[Outgoing webhook bots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-outgoing-webhook) provide a threaded reply when @mentioned in a message and are an easy way to add powerful automation capabilities to MS Teams.

[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev/) is serverless computing platform with excellent performance and globally redundancy with a fantastic developer CLI called [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) for deploying and configuring your workers.

[bradyjoslin/msteams-webhook-worker-template](https://github.com/bradyjoslin/msteams-webhook-worker-template) is a [wrangler template](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) that helps kick start Cloudflare Worker-based outgoing webhook bots for MS Teams.  To use the template to create a new bot project simply run:

```bash
wrangler generate <projectname> https://github.com/bradyjoslin/msteams-webhook-worker-template
```

### tldr - A Sample Bot

[tldr (‚ÄúToo Long; Didn't Read‚Äù)](https://github.com/bradyjoslin/msteams-tldr/) is a sample open source bot built using the wrangler template.  When @mentioned in a post or comment in a message containing a URL the bot replies with a 3-sentence summary of the web page.

![tldr conversation](tldr.png)

The idea for tldr bot came from [this article](https://blog.concurlabs.com/how-to-write-a-tldr-chat-bot-ec02d9e1649c) from the Concur Labs team and mostly implemented as a proof of concept. I wanted to explore the least complicated solution that provides similar functionality to what was described in the article by using existing services and avoid deploying any infrastructure.

### How tldr Works

When creating an outgoing webhook in MS Teams [(docs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-outgoing-webhook#create-an-outgoing-webhook) you are provided an HMAC secret token that can be used to verify incoming request signatures.  To make that secret available to your worker, add a [worker secret variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/secrets/) named `SECRET`. This can be configured using Wrangler:

```bash
wrangler secret put SECRET
```

Teams sends a POST request with an HMAC signature that contains information about the message to the worker when the bot is @mentioned. The worker first verifies the webhook signature using the `SECRET` variable.


```javascript
function verifySignature(body, signature) {
  let bufSecret = Buffer.from(SECRET, 'base64')
  let msgBuf = Buffer.from(body, 'utf8')

  let msgHash =
    'HMAC ' +
    crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', bufSecret)
      .update(msgBuf)
      .digest('base64')
      
  return msgHash === signature
}
```

With the HMAC signature verified, a regular expression looks for and obtains the first URL from the Teams message and calls a function to get a summary.

```javascript
let json = JSON.parse(body)
let message = json.text

let urlMatcher = /(?<=a href=?")([h]t{1,2}ps?:\/\/.*?)(?=")/.exec(message)
let url = urlMatcher != null && urlMatcher.length ? urlMatcher[0] : ''

let summary = await getSummary(url)
```

The summary function makes an API call to [nlp/SummarizeURL](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/SummarizeURL) on Algorithmia's algorithm-as-a-service platform.  Sign up for a free account at [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/) and obtain an API key.  Add a worker secret variable named `ALGO_KEY` to share the API Key to your worker.

```bash
wrangler secret put ALGO_KEY
```

Cloudflare workers can make outbound HTTP calls using the standard [Fetch API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/fetch/).

```javascript
async function getSummary(url) {
  let algo =
    'https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/nlp/SummarizeURL/0.1.4?timeout=300'
  let summary = await fetch(algo, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: ALGO_KEY,
    },
    body: url,
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => json.result)

  return summary
}
```

Then the worker replies with a JSON response.

```javascript
return new Response(`{"type": "message","text": "${summary}"}`, {
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
})
```

Deployment is automated through the [Wrangler GitHub Action](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action), but would be done locally using:

```bash
wrangler publish
```

With just 63 lines of JavaScript, the majority of which is provided by the project template, and a few configuration steps we were able to make a Teams bot with some fairly interesting functionality.
