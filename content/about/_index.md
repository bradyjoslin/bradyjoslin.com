Hi, I'm Brady Joslin. A developer at heart currently exploring [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). Also spend time studying [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) and ways to [embrace reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfrrubw7pcE").

For fun enjoy hitting the slopes in Colorado and cruising around on my [Onewheel](https://onewheel.com/).

Currently working as Director of Application Services at a Fortune 500 company in Houston, TX,
leading wonderful teams who create custom web and mobile applications and build solutions on
platforms like Sharepoint and Jira.

Opinions expressed here are my own and not the views of my employer.
